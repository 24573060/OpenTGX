## About KFC
`KFC` to do nothing with the fried chicken food, it is short fore Kylin's Framework Core.

After communicate with thousends of developers, I find many strong needs as below.

1. **Skill Improvement**: Learn more tricks and get more practical experience
2. **Well-organized Project Templates**: Speed up project development.
3. **High Quality Framework**: Useful Solutions to solove plenty of basic requirements and problems.

So I write and open-source the `KylinsToolkit` project, name the framework core as `KFC`.

More and more components will be added in the future, such as networking, 2d games components, 3d games component, etc.

For now, `KFC` contains the following parts.
- `kylins_base`: some basic components, such as resolution fit, resource loading queue, audio play, input management, etc.
- `kylins_camera`：free camera, fps camera, third person camera, 2d following camera and so on.
- `kylins_easy_controller`： virtual joysitck, supports 2D and 3D projects, buttons, and camera controllers.
- `kylins_ui_framework`：a simples MVVM style UI framework, supports ui layer management, resouces load, events auto management, etc.
