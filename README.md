## Why You Need It?

After communicate with thousends of developers, I find many strong needs as below.

1. **Skill Improvement**: Learn more tricks and get more practical experience
2. **Well-organized Project Templates**: Speed up project development.
3. **High Quality Framework**: Useful Solutions to solove plenty of basic requirements and problems.

So I write and open-source the `OpenTsGDS` project.

Most of the content is based on my 15y+ experience in game development. It's not perfect but can solve many problems to speed up your development progress and make your project management easier when working tegether with many team members.

More and more components will be added in the future, such as networking, 2d games components, 3d games component, etc.

From this, Mr Kylin(me) will work together with other developers based on `OpenTsGDS` to give you more projects, examples and tutorials which we think can help you a lot.

I hope more and more developers join us to make `OpenTsGDS` better.
